Long time ago when was trying to understand crypto and I've come across Atomic Wallet. At this time my friend was working for this "company", this is just a bunch of people (and I assume still is). So, I knew the level of trustworthiness of this wallet and it was pretty low.

I bought some crypto anyway just to learn and I've decided to put there "whatever I will not be very sad to lose". This all were very new to me and using this wallet was easy and everything was okay for some time(years in fact).

# Then Happend June 3rd hack
First of all no one notified me. I had to **google** why my money were lost.
I figured this several months after this happend when I was trying to check how much I have. I found out about hack and turns out I lost money too. Not all coins though, but just Bitcoin strangely.
So, they were "hacked" and I have 2 wallet clients installed on 2 platforms, subscribed to email newsletter and I didn't get any notifications **in months**. And I'm not alone, they didn't send it to anyone. They purpusefully hidden this information from all users.

After this they started to delete comments, at first they closed them, then they tried to open them again, but got a lot of comments about scam and they closed comments again. Now they block people on Twitter(X).


# News on network
Twitter account [AtomicWallet is a SCAM](https://twitter.com/AtomicW_SCAM) that tries to be the first thing you see when searching for AtomicWallet.

Some bad reviews on [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/atomicwallet.io?page=2), they still have some good reviews, new users I guess. Most of them left just one good review, I assume they are bots. And most upvoted reviews are 1 star reviews anyway.
