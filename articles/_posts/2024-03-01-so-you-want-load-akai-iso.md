So, if youare like me just discovered [Sample and Sample-Patch CDs](https://archive.org/details/samplecds) on Internet Archive then you are probaly downladed some of the CDs that are appear to be ISO, but they are not mounting.

That is because they are most likely AKAI ISO files, and to open them people on internet suggest to use Kontakt 5. 
I have K7, it is better right? No. As I understood only K5 can open them.

But also this guy can!

It is Free VST, or rather VST that have free version [TX16Wx Software Sampler](https://www.tx16wx.com/).
You just load this VST and then select your ISO in file browser on left side.

Usually in those folders you have files with `.p` extension, they are your patches. And `.s` files, they are samples.
Just double click on patch file and press Regions, this will open piano roll with visual mapping of samples to keys. It is easier to see where on keyboard this patch have samples assigned.

I don't know if this VST can mount EMU CDs as well, but you are welcome to try yourself.
There is also famous alternative [Chicken Translator 7](https://www.chickensys.com/products2/translator/), but this one is standalone.

Happy sampling.
